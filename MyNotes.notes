JWT(JSON WEB TOKENS)

-> definition: JWT is a standard for creating tokens that assert some number of claims. For example, a server could generate a token that has the claim "logged in as admin" and provide that to a client. The client could then use that token to prove that it is logged in as admin.

-> Structure: JWT consist of three parts: Header, Payload, Signature. They are typically encoded and signed using cryptographic algorithms.

-> Usage: JWT are commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web development. They are used to securely transmit information between parties.

-> Statelessness : JWT are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to store any information about the client. This makes them ideal for use in distributed systems.
